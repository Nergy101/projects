welcome to (project?) hermes, the messemger of the gods.

the plan is to use broadcasts to establish a connection between the server and the nodes(different pi's),
and to then share data and sync n atuff.

1. See who's on the network DONE using server.py and client.py

2. set up secure connection with nodes found on network using the stuff inside testing/

3. transmit whatever data you want one on one
